## What is ERS?

EvoStream Rendezvous Server (ERS) allows EMS and client browser to be able to meet and communicate with each other without knowing each otherâ€™s IP addresses. It acts as the signaling server needed to establish connection between these endpoints.

## Key Features

- Acts as signaling server
- Capable of serving static html pages
- Protect streams through tokens

## Pre-requisites

### A. STUN Server

STUN is a set of methods and network protocols to allow an end host to discover its public IP address even if it's located behind a NAT. This server is used by ERS to allow both EMS and the client end-point (browser) to discover their respective IP addresses. Restund is the recommended open-source STUN/TURN server to be used with ERS.

The default configuration of ERS already points to a public EvoStream STUN server. However, hosting your own STUN/TURN server is also possible as described below.

To install and host restund on Linux, execute the following instructions:

1. Make sure that build-essential and unzip packages are already installed. On a debian-based Linux, these can be done through the following:
   
        apt-get install build-essential
        apt-get install unzip

2. Download and install the toolkit library to be used by restund:
   
        wget http://www.creytiv.com/pub/re-0.4.12.tar.gz
        tar -xzf re-0.4.12.tar.gz
        cd re-0.4.12/
        make
        sudo make install

3. Download and install restund itself:
   
        wget https://github.com/otalk/restund/archive/master.zip
        unzip master.zip
        cd restund-master
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig

4. Configure restund (following is a basic sample config file):
   
        #
        # restund.conf
        #
        # core
        #
        daemon no
        debug yes
        realm TestRealmThatCanBeChanged
        syncinterval 600
        udp_listen <ip>:<port>
        udp_sockbuf_size 524288
        tcp_listen <ip>:<port>
        #
        # modules (STUN messages are processed in module loading order)
        #
        module_path /usr/local/lib/restund/modules
        module stat.so
        module binding.so
        module syslog.so
        module status.so
        #
        # syslog
        #
        syslog_facility 24

5. Copy the updated configuration file:
   
        sudo cp restund.conf /etc/

6. Run restund:

        sudo restund /etc/restund.conf # add -d option for daemon

### B. Node.JS

Node.js is a server side JavaScript runtime utilized to run ERS.

For Linux/Unix variants, a helper script is available to automate the installation process. See Automatic section.

For windows platforms and/or manual installation:

Download and install or extract node.js from their website: [*https://nodejs.org/en/download/*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If extracted, add the Node.JS location to the environment path so that the corresponding binaries can be found even if packages are installed on different folder location.

### C. NPM

The Node Package Manager allows easy installation of a Node.JS package and its dependencies. NPM will be used to install ERS. NPM is already part of the Node.JS application.

### D. PM2

Although not necessarily a prerequisite, a Node.JS application/process manager can be installed, as well. This will manage the ERS process and restart it in case of failures and/or machine restart if configured. Currently PM2 is the recommended package for this task.

This package is already automatically installed through the Linux/Unix helper script as described on Automatic section.

To manually install pm2 package:

    npm install -g pm2
